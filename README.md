Roguelike Hangman Game Concept
1. Core Gameplay:

Objective: The player's goal is to guess the hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts, just like traditional hangman.

Procedural Generation: The words are randomly generated from a predefined list or an external API, ensuring a new word is selected each time a new game starts.

Permadeath: If the player fails to guess the word within the allowed number of incorrect guesses, the game ends and the player must start over from scratch, losing all progress.

2. Roguelike Elements:

Levels and Difficulty: As the player successfully guesses words, the game progresses through levels. Each level increases in difficulty by using longer or more complex words and reducing the number of allowed incorrect guesses.

Progression and Scoring: Players earn points for each correctly guessed word and receive bonuses for completing levels. The score resets if the player loses, emphasizing the permadeath aspect.

Random Events: To enhance the roguelike experience, random events can be introduced. For example, certain letters may appear more frequently, or players might get bonuses for guessing multiple words in a row without losing.

3. Additional Features:

Power-Ups: Players can earn or find power-ups that provide hints, additional guesses, or other advantages.

Leaderboards: Track high scores and allow players to compete for the highest scores globally or within a community.

Themes and Customizations: Allow players to customize the visual appearance of the game, such as changing the hangman illustration or background themes.
