Dear [Team or Recipient Name at Code: You],
I hope this note finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to explain the delay in completing my project. Over the past few weeks, several of my family members underwent back-to-back surgeries, requiring significant care and support during their recovery. I also had to step in to babysit, ensuring their little ones were cared for while they healed.
Unfortunately, these unforeseen circumstances left me unable to dedicate the time and focus needed to complete the project on schedule. I tried my best to get it in on time, however despite my best efforts it will be slightly late,
I truly value the opportunity to work on this and am committed to finishing it as soon as possible.
Thank you for your understanding and support during this time. Please let me know if there's anything further I need to provide or arrange moving forward.
Sincerely,
Skyler

Got itâ€”thanks for clarifying! Here's the updated README file reflecting the changes to your project:
